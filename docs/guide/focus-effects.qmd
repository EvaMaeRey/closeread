title: Focus Effects
---

Focus effects are used to closely guide your readers attention to particular aspects of your stickies. They are all supplied as [attributes](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#ordering-of-attributes), which follow a `attribute="value"` syntax where the value must be quoted and where `=` separates the value from the attribute with no spaces. 

## Highlighting

You can highlight parts of the code and text of your sticky using the following syntax.

1. `highlight="1,3"`: highlight lines 1 and 3
2. `highlight="1-3"`: highlight lines 1, 2, and 3
3. `highlight="cr-span1"`: highlight the span with id `cr-span1`
4. `highlight="cr-span1,cr-span2"`: highlight the spans with ids `cr-span1` and `cr-span2`

Line highlighting (1 and 2) works on code cells and line blocks while span highlighting (3 and 4) only works on Line Blocks.

### Code Cell Examples

This will highlight lines 1 and 2:

````qmd
This is where we load the library. [@cr-dplyr]{highlight="1,2"}

:::{#cr-dplyr}
```{{r}}
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins |>
  group_by(island) |>
  summarize(avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm))
```
:::
````

This will highlight lines 4 through 6.

````qmd
This calculates summary statistics. [@cr-dplyr]{highlight="4-6"}

:::{#cr-dplyr}
```{{r}}
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins |>
  group_by(island) |>
  summarize(avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm))
```
:::
````

Highlighting spans of code within a line is currently not possible.
