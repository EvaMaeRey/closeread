If you've never made a Closeread document, copy and paste the following document into a qmd document.

```{.markdown filename="myfirstcr.qmd"}

title: My First Closeread
format: closeread-html

Hello World! Please read my closeread story below.

:::{.cr-section}

Closeread enables scrollytelling.

Draw your readers attention with focus effects. @cr-features

:::{#cr-features}

```

In the same directory as this qmd file, run the following command to make the Closeread extension available to this document.

```bash
quarto add qmd-lab/closeread
```

Now you can render the document and scroll through your first scrollytelling story. Continue the adventure by reading this Guide:

- [Components of a Closeread Document](components.qmd) teaches you the essential parts of a Closeread document: sections, stickies and triggers.
- [Focus Effects](focus-effects.qmd) let you guide your readers to parts of your content by highlighting text and code, or zooming in on parts of an image or text. You can also ensure that content scales responsively, no matter what devices your readers use.
- [Layouts](layouts.qmd) teaches you how to customise the layouts of your Closeread sections - that is, where the stickies and triggers sit - as well as other useful tools that change the structure of the page.
- [Interactive Graphics](authoring-tools.qmd) shows you how use [Observable JavaScript](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/ojs.html) to make graphics that animate as your user scrolls.
- [Styling](styling.qmd) teaches you how to change the appearance of your documents from the default Quarto theme.

When you've finished the Guide, be sure to have a look at the [Gallery](/gallery) for more examples of what you can do with Closeread!
