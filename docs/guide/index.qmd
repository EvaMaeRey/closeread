If you've never made a Closeread document, start with the very minimal example on the [home page](/), then come back here!

[Components of a Closeread document](components.qmd) teaches you the essential parts of a Closeread document: sections, stickies and triggers.

[Focus Effects](focus-effects.qmd) let you guide your readers to parts of your content by highlighting text and code, or zooming in on parts of an image or text. You can also ensure that content scales responsively, no matter what devices your readers use.

[Layouts](layouts.qmd) teaches you how to customise the layouts of your Closeread sections - that is, where the stickies and triggers sit - as well as other useful tools that change the structure of the page.

[Authoring tools](authoring-tools.qmd) covers other useful tools to help you generate scrollytelling content, including ways to use [Observable JavaScript](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/ojs.html) to make animated graphics with Closeread.

[Styling](styling.qmd) shows you how to change the appearance of your documents from the default Quarto theme.

When you've finished the Guide, be sure to have a look at the [Gallery](/gallery) for more examples of what you can do with Closeread!

This is an open-source tool built upon other open-source tools. Closeread extends [Quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli), a tool for technical publishing sponsored by Posit, PBC. The responsivity to user scrolling is made possible by the [scrollama v3.0](https://github.com/russellsamora/scrollama) JavaScript library by Russell Samora. Both tools are open-source and distributed under an MIT License.
