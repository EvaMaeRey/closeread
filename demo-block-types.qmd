# Test other sticky block types

First paragraph.

::: {}
This is a para nested in a div. These two first bits don't trigger anything...
:::

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-to="pink"}
This is an image with the sticky tag on the div.
:::

:::{cr-id="pink"}
x![This is a caption](pink-desktop.png)
:::

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="pink" cr-to="blue"}
This is an image with the sticky tag on Image itself.

I've replaced its margin with some padding to demonstrate that you can give it a larger "surface" area on which to trigger scroll events.
:::

![](blue-desktop.png){cr-id="blue"}

::::{.column-screen-inset style="background-color: #dddddd; padding: 50px;"}
Here's a little non-scrolling interlude before our next scrolly section!
::::

::::{.cr-layout}

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-to="scatter"}
This is a scatterplot.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| cr-id: scatter

plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$dist)
```

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="scatter" cr-to="hist"}
This is a histogram.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| cr-id: hist
#| fig-cap: "This is a caption."
#| fig-height: 4

hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="hist" cr-to="list"}
This is a list (a block element).
:::

:::{cr-id="list"}
1. Apple
2. Banana
:::

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="list" cr-to="displaymath"}
This is display math, but I'm making it a bit longer so that it covers a few lines.
:::

::: {cr-id="displaymath"}

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{y} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon \\
&= 3.4 + 1.2 x
\end{align}
$$

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="displaymath" cr-to="mypoem"}
This is a poem. It's called ["Bellringer", by Rita Dove](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2019-in-review/our-year-in-poems).
:::

```{.cr-poem cr-id="mypoem"}
I was given a name, it came out of a book—
I don’t know which. I’ve been told the Great Man
could recite every title in order on its shelf.
Well, I was born, and that’s a good thing,
although I arrived on the day of his passing,

a day on which our country fell into mourning.
This I heard over and over, from professors
to farmers, even duel-scarred students;
sometimes, in grand company, remarked upon
in third person—a pretty way of saying

more than two men in a room means the third
can be ignored, as I was when they spoke
of my birth and Mr. Jefferson’s death
in one breath, voices dusted with wonderment,
faint sunlight quivering on a hidden breeze.
```

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="mypoem" cr-to="mermaid"}
This is a mermaid diagram
:::

```{mermaid}
%%| cr-id: mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
```

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="mermaid" cr-to="graphviz"}
This is a graphviz diagram
:::

```{dot}
//| cr-id: graphviz
graph G {
  layout=neato
  run -- intr;
  intr -- runbl;
}
