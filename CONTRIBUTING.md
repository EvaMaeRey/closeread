## Pull Requests

Pull requests are very welcome! Here's how to contribute via PR:

1.  Fork the repository, clone it locally, and make your changes in a new branch specific to the PR.
2.  Submit the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) into the `dev` branch. It is ok to submit as "draft" in your are still working on it but would like some feedback from us. It always good to share in the open that you are working on it.
3.  The maintainers will provide feedback on the PR and if its within scope and well-implemented, it will get merged into `dev`.
4.  Once there is a critical mass of new features and fixes on `dev`, it will be merged into `main` and a new version of Closeread will be released.

We'll try to be as responsive as possible in reviewing and accepting pull requests.
