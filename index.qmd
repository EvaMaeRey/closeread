Closeread enables the reader to zoom in on particular bits of both code and text using a similar syntax.

To zoom to particular lines of code for your reader, you can add an attribute to your trigger called `highlight`. To highlight lines of code, you can either use a series of line numbers separated by commas or a range separate by a hyphen. Some examples:

- `zoom-to="1,5"`: highlight lines 1 and 5
- `highlight="1-5"`: highlight lines 1 through 5

The following section demonstrates that functionality.

:::{.cr-section}

The limerick is a form of poetry composed of five lines.

Here is the first limerick appearing in the written record, from the *Saint John Daily News* in 1880. @cr-limerick

The end of the first two lines of a Limerick must rhyme. [@cr-limerick]{zoom-to="1"}

The end third and fourth line also rhyme and are nudged in a bit. [@cr-limerick]{zoom-to="14"}

The end third and fourth line also rhyme and are nudged in a bit. [@cr-limerick]{zoom-to="cr-salary"}


:::{#cr-limerick .scale-to-fill}

Now here is some code zooming.

:::{.cr-section}

The limerick is a form of poetry composed of five lines.

Here is the first limerick appearing in the written record, from the *Saint John Daily News* in 1880. @cr-dplyr

The end of the first two lines of a Limerick must rhyme. [@cr-dplyr]{zoom-to="18"}

The end third and fourth line also rhyme and are nudged in a bit. [@cr-dplyr]{zoom-to="3"}


:::{#cr-dplyr .scale-to-fill}
```r
library(dplyr)

  select(mpg, hp) |>
  select(mpg, hp) |>
  select(mpg, hp) |>
  select(mpg, hp) |>
